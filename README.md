Hey there, I'm NovaCow!  
I'm a part-time dev who decided that Python is his language of choice.  
I develop for fun and not really to achieve anything.  
Currently working on a command inperpreter to let my graphing calculator do something useful.  
If you need to contact me ever, I'm on discord! My username is novacow.
